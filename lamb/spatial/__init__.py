"""
Spatial indexing structures for the LAMB framework.

This module provides efficient spatial data structures for different paradigms:
- GridIndex: Discrete space with O(rÂ²) neighbor queries
- KDTreeIndex: Continuous space with O(log n + k) range queries  
- GraphIndex: Network space with O(1) direct neighbor lookup

Based on Technical_Specification.md paradigm-specific sections.
Performance characteristics validated from reconnaissance data.
