"""
Factory methods for creating LAMB simulations.

This module provides factory methods that enable AI-friendly configuration
and easy simulation creation. Factories handle the complexity of component
creation and validation, allowing users to create simulations through
simple, semantic configuration.

Factories:
- SimulationFactory: Main factory for creating complete simulations
- EnvironmentFactory: Creates environments for different paradigms
- AgentFactory: Creates agents with different personalities
- EngineFactory: Creates decision engines (LLM, Rule, Hybrid)
- ExecutorFactory: Creates paradigm-specific executors
